_The following points are personal views and by no means a yardstick for the perfect MS Application_

This post's timeline is for a Fall admission cycle. Your preparation essentially includes the following:

[Accepting Universities](#accepting-universities)  



### Finding the Right Course
_May - June/July_  

Give yourself enough time to take up smaller courses on topics you like, or in general read about the courses offered by the top universities (MIT, University of Michigan, Columbia, Georgia Tech etc).
Around this time, start browsing the top universities’ websites and get familiar with their navigation. They can be quite confusing and will take time to get used to.

Criteria that are often taken into consideration:
* University reputation/rank as well as ranking of the course
* Number of Labs one can work in
* Background of Professors (Fulbright/Rhode scholars etc)
* Job and internship opportunities
* Location - not just in terms of weather but also demographics. (for example if you’re into robotics its best if you’re in the Pennsylvania, Massachusetts or Bay area as they are the epicenters for robotics startups and so on)
* Cost (fees + housing) - Ivy leagues tend to be exorbitant.
* RA/TA opportunities
* Acceptance rates - at times it does not really make sense to apply if a university has a 1% acceptance rate that too only for locals.
* Course flexibility - some universities have more compulsory courses, while others give you the flexibility of choosing whichever subjects you would prefer (including courses from other departments).

No doubt top universities are extremely difficult to get into but, play your cards correctly and you can get a good admit. 
There is no right or wrong end result of the admission process. There are many factors that could encumber or boost your success (including luck).


### Standardised Tests and CGPA 
_August-September_

Statistically speaking most acceptances in top universities do have scores of 167+ Q and 157+ V. But that does not mean a lower score eliminates your chances of a good admission. 

#### GRE - one solution, practice and practice

- 2-3 months of preparation should be enough.
- **GRE Registration Cost**: $205 (Includes 2 Powerprep tests as well).
- **The best material to practice**: The official ETS Questions (from the guide + look for more question sets available).
- **For verbal**: Give equal importance to Reading Comprehension and words. It takes a while to get used to their pattern. Do not be gutted if you don’t score a 150+ on your first attempt.
- **Practice Resources**: Manhattan, Magoosh (app) etc are good for practice - they help with time management.
- **YouTube Channel**: GregMat - great for the GRE (Especially Verbal and AWA). Useful tips.
- **Timing**: Keep solving papers to get used to the timing. (PowerPrep practice tests are the closest available to what you will come across on the actual GRE).
- **Quants**: Go through all the topics in the official guide and practice difficult problems on the same. Keep timing yourself.
- **AWA**: It is at the start of the exam and it can drain you. Get your friends to read your essays. You will need sufficient practice till you become good at AWA. 
  - **Tip**: Structure of the essay carries more weight than the content.  

#### TOEFL iBT - English Proficiency Test

- If you have scored well in the GRE, the TOEFL should be much simpler.
- **TOEFL Registration Cost**: $185.
- **Reading**: Passages like the GRE, but questions are much more straightforward.
- **Listening**: Make sure to take sufficient notes here! Questions will be direct for the most part.
- **Speaking**: Focus on content more than delivery. Take a look at the sample audio clips by candidates on the TOEFL website.
- **Writing**: Again, straightforward. A couple of practice essays and you should be set.

#### Sending GRE/TOEFL Scores to Universities

You can send your GRE score to up to 4 universities right after the exam.
- Make sure you have the University Code and Department Code (if it is there) of your respective course. You will have to feed these in to successfully send the GRE scores.
- While filling out the TOEFL form, you can select up to 4 universities.
- You can send your GRE/TOEFL scores to universities later as well by logging into your ETS account.
  - **GRE**: $27 per additional score report.
  - **TOEFL**: $20 per additional score report.

#### CGPA during Engineering:

_Yes_, it is important and does play a substantial role in your admissions. Try to maintain a CGPA of 9+ (very idealistic) but an 8+ can also get you a good admit (provided you have a very good profile as well). So, FYs and SYs, if you’re reading this, time to get those grades up!

### Academic Transcripts
_October_

- The Exam Section will release a form which has the price for the transcripts.
- You have to pay a fixed amount for one transcript and an additional amount for every extra transcript you take. 
- Around 5-6 transcripts should be more than enough.
- Once you make the payment on the SBI portal, attach the receipt and send it to the specified email address (on the form) along with your grade sheets of all the sems.
- The exam section will process your request and get back to you in 1-2 weeks.
- Try to get your transcripts before you start applying.
- Check your transcripts for any mistakes, if any.

### Letters of Recommendation
_October-November_

- Say you are applying to 10 universities, each requiring 3 LORs. In all you will need 30 LORs.
- Identify 4 professors (for safety) who would be willing to write you a recommendation.
  - **Recommender 1**: FYP mentor (to attest to your application skills).
  - **Recommender 2**: Head of any lab you have worked for (e.g CoE, IoT Lab, BCT Lab) (to attest to your research skills).
  - **Recommender 3**: Professor who has taught you for over a year (to attest to your academic skills).
  - **Recommender 4**: Professor who has taught you for over a year.
  - **Recommender 5**: Mentor from any research internship (to attest to your research skills).
- Keep more options on hand as a few recommenders may not provide LORs to ALL the universities you are applying to.
- Send reminders to upload your LOR as needed to your recommenders. The university deadlines to accept the LORs are strict and will not be changed for you.
- Some universities e.g UC Berkeley, UCLA do not have an upper cap on LORs, you can submit as many as you like. (However, there is no guarantee that each will be considered).
- LORs are basically your professors attesting to all the work you have done and mentioned in your application.

### Statement of Purpose 
_October-Till the last application_

This is the most important document you will prepare during your applications. Write a different SOP for each university, keeping in mind their beliefs and principles.
- Once you have a rough draft, RESEARCH about each university extensively. Read about their Labs, professors, principles, beliefs.
- You have to show the university that you are a good fit, a valuable asset and you will help them further the research already conducted. Also, you have to vividly mention how that particular program will help you achieve your goals (both short-term and long-term).
- It's highly recommended to have one paragraph in your SOP dedicated to that particular university. You can also interweave university specific details in your projects, opening and closing paragraphs. 
- Projects and Commpetitions.
  - Their details are not necessary. Rather include what was your role and what were the outcomes.
  - How has this project helped you? How does this further entrench your belief to pursue this field?
  - Highlight how each project brought out some quality in you.
  - How does this project align with what you want to do at that university? (Most important).
- Internships:
  - Talk about any related internships.
  - What did you work on? How did you overcome challenges?
  - How will the internship help you in your masters?
  - What was the outcome of your internship?
  - Again, extreme minute technical details are not needed.
- All universities have different maximum lengths of SOPs (e.g 500 words, 1400 words or 2 pages max). Tailor each SOP in accordance with what the university expects.
- Counsellors can help only embellish and provide a good flow to your SOP, but the content has to be provided by you.
- Write out a first draft and later look at the sample SOPs in this folder, but don’t get fixed on the same pattern and definitely DO NOT COPY.
- The SOP is a dynamic document and will keep getting better with every iteration. Keep updating till your last application is done.

### Resume/CV
(October-Till the last Application)

**Resume**: Generally used while applying for a job.  
**CV**: Generally used while applying for a position at an educational institution.  
For convenienve we will use these words interchangeably.

- **General Format** (no right or wrong format, do what best suits you):
  - Name is big and clear. Add contact info next to the name (LinkedIn URL optional) (Include application ID - email).
  - **Education**
  - **Experience**
  - **Publications/Patents**
  - **Projects**
  - **Achievements**
  - **Voluntary work**
  - **Relevant coursework** (if needed)
  - **Technical Skills + Certifications/licenses**
- Keep the resume up to 2 pages.
- Add all the important projects/competitions you have worked on. 1-2 lines describing each of them. Mention your work and its outcome.
- Attach links to your work e.g certificate link, project website, competition winner page.
- The format has to be clear, easy to read. Using LaTeX is a good idea, word templates are also equally effective.
- Use effective verbs that convey the right meaning e.g developed, constructed, imbibed.



### Application Form

- Each university has a long application form you have to fill.
- It's a good idea to open one and fill in all the details just to get acquainted with the system.
- Generally, you can fill in all the details and revisit your application form. All the details are saved.
- You can upload the transcripts, SOP etc as and when you are ready with those documents. But make sure everything is uploaded before the deadline.
- Take a look, some universities have early applications and regular applications. The deadlines are varied. Keep a check on those. Early deadlines are generally for availing scholarships.
- The application fee can range from $65 to $140.
- Keep checking the university website regularly; they will post updates, FAQs. A lot of the answers can be found there.
- You can submit your application before your LORs are uploaded.
- You can email the university as well in case of any other difficulties. They are quite responsive.

### Accepting Universities

Make a pros and cons list.

There are multiple factors that can influence your decision. Some of the important ones that you should consider are:

- **Courses/Course structure** (most important)
- **Ranking of the universities** (don’t blindly go by this as it is extremely subjective, but some websites give a fair estimate of universities’ standings with respect to each other).
  - For Computer Science: https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings 
- **Faculty, their Research and different Research Labs** (if your interest lies in research)
- **Career fairs and placements, location of placements** (for most people, getting a job after graduation will be a primary goal, so look into which companies visit the campus, placement ratios, location at which the job is provided, etc.)
- **Cost of attendance/financial aid and scholarships** (some unis will be more costly than others - if your primary motive is to reduce costs, this will be a key factor).
- **Opportunities for on-campus jobs and positions like RA/TA/GA**.
- **Student to teacher ratio** (some unis have huge class sizes, e.g. 700+ for popular courses).
- After going through all of the above, if you still cannot decide, you can look into factors like location of the university, culture, weather, etc. (secondary factors).


In conclusion, the application process is a long and arduous one. It is important to keep your calm and not get bogged down by the process. It is also important to remember that the process is not the end of the world. Good luck with your applications!
